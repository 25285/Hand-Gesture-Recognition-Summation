# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Summation
This project implements a real-time hand gesture recognition system that can detect the number of fingers extended on a human hand and perform basic arithmetic (summation) based on sequential hand gestures. Built with Python, it leverages the power of MediaPipe for accurate hand landmark detection and OpenCV for video processing and visualization
