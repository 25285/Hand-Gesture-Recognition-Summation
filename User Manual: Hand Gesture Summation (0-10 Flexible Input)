User Manual: Hand Gesture Summation (0-10 Flexible Input)
This program allows you to perform basic addition using hand gestures recognized by your webcam. You can input numbers from 1 to 10 by showing fingers on one or two hands.

1. Program Overview
The program operates in different states:

Waiting for First Number: The program is ready to receive your first number.
First Number Captured: Your first number has been recognized and locked in. The program is now waiting for the second number.
Second Number Captured & Sum Displayed: Your second number has been recognized, and the sum is displayed.
Reset: The calculation is cleared, and the program returns to the "Waiting for First Number" state.
2. How to Perform Gestures (1-10)
The program counts the total number of extended fingers across all detected hands.

Numbers 1 to 5 (One Hand):

Show the corresponding number of fingers on a single hand. Ensure your fingers are clearly extended and separated.
Examples:
1: Index finger extended, others closed.
2: Index and middle fingers extended, others closed.
3: Thumb, index, and middle fingers extended OR index, middle, and ring fingers extended.
4: Four fingers extended (excluding thumb).
5: All five fingers extended (open palm).
Numbers 6 to 10 (Two Hands):

Combine fingers across both hands to reach the desired number.
Examples:
6: One hand showing 5 (open palm) + the other hand showing 1 (index finger).
7: One hand showing 5 + the other hand showing 2.
8: One hand showing 5 + the other hand showing 3.
9: One hand showing 5 + the other hand showing 4.
10: Both hands showing 5 (two open palms).
Zero (Reset):

To clear any ongoing calculation or the displayed sum, show zero fingers (a closed fist) with any hand that is detected, or simply remove all your hands from the camera's view.
3. Input Methods for Addition
The program supports two flexible ways to input your numbers for addition:

Method 1: Sequential Input (One Hand / Changing Hands)
This is ideal for users who prefer to show one number at a time.

Show the First Number:

Clearly show your first number (1-10) using one or two hands.
Hold this gesture steady for approximately 1 second. The program will display "Holding X for X.Xs..." to indicate it's recognizing your input.
Once the 1-second stabilization is complete, the program will lock in the First: X and tell you to wait.
Wait for the Delay:

After the first number is locked, the program will require a 2-second delay before it's ready for the second number. You'll see a countdown like "(Wait X.Xs for new number)".
During this delay, you can either keep your hands in the previous position or relax them, but make sure to not show a new, distinct number yet.
Show the Second Number:

After the 2-second delay, clearly show your second number (1-10). You can use:
The same hand(s) by changing the number of extended fingers.
A different combination of hands (e.g., if you used one hand for the first number, you can now use two hands for the second).
As soon as a new, non-zero number is detected after the delay, it will be recognized as the second number.
Sum Displayed: The program will then immediately display the Sum: X + Y = Z.

Method 2: Simultaneous Input (Two Hands)
This method is faster if you intend to use two hands for both numbers.

Show First Number with One Hand:

Start by showing your first number (1-5) on a single hand.
Hold this gesture steady for approximately 1 second to let the program capture it as First: X.
Immediately Show Second Number with the Other Hand:

Without waiting for the 2-second sequential delay, bring up your second hand and show the appropriate number of fingers to represent your second input.
The program will detect the presence of the second hand and its count, and it will be recognized as the second number.
Sum Displayed: The sum will be calculated and displayed immediately.

Important Note on Simultaneous Input: While the program has a 2-second delay for sequential input on the same set of hands, if you introduce a second hand with a value that creates a new total number (0-10) after the first number is registered, the system will often capture it quickly without enforcing the full 2-second delay, as it understands a new input method has been initiated.

4. On-Screen Feedback
The program provides real-time information:

"Total Fingers: X": Displays the current total number of fingers detected across all hands (0-10). This is for your reference and troubleshooting.
"Left: X" / "Right: X": Shows the individual finger count (0-5) for each detected hand, positioned near the hand.
"Show 1-10 fingers to start sum": Initial prompt.
"Holding X for X.Xs...": Indicates that the program is trying to stabilize your first number. Hold your hand(s) steady.
"First: X": Confirms that the first number has been successfully captured.
"(Wait X.Xs for new number)": Countdown for the 2-second delay before the second number can be accepted in sequential mode.
"(Show 2nd num: 1-10)": Prompt to show the second number.
"Sum: X + Y = Z": Displays the calculated addition result.
"Show 0 fingers or remove hands to reset.": Reminder on how to clear the calculation.
Reset Messages (e.g., "Timeout: No hands detected.", "Zero shown (clearing calculation).", "Reset if no new input..."): Inform you when and why the program is resetting.
5. Tips for Best Performance
Lighting: Ensure your hands are well-lit, preferably with even, diffused light. Avoid strong backlighting or shadows that obscure your fingers.
Background: Use a plain, contrasting background behind your hands. Avoid cluttered backgrounds that can confuse the detection algorithm.
Hand Position:
Keep your hands within the webcam's view.
Try to hold your hands relatively flat towards the camera.
Ensure fingers are clearly extended and separated for accurate counting. Avoid fingers overlapping or being too close together.
Keep your palm relatively open (not tightly clenched) when extending fingers.
Movement: When setting a number, try to hold your hand(s) as still as possible for the required stabilization time. Rapid movements can cause flickering counts.
Distance: Experiment with the distance of your hands from the webcam. Too close or too far can affect detection accuracy. A good starting point is about arm's length.
Confidence: The program is set with a confidence level (0.7). If it's struggling, try to make your gestures more pronounced.
Smoothing Buffer: The BUFFER_SIZE is set to 7 frames for smoothing. This helps prevent minor flickers from changing the count instantly.
6. Troubleshooting
"Not Responding Properly":
Check your lighting and background.
Ensure your fingers are clearly extended and separated.
Are you holding your hands steady for the required 1 second for the first number?
Are you waiting for the 2-second delay (if using sequential input) before showing the second number?
If numbers are flickering rapidly, adjust your hand position or lighting.
Program Freezes / Crashes:
Ensure no other applications are using your webcam.
Restart the program and try again.
Check your webcam drivers.
If the issue persists, your system might be struggling with the real-time processing; try closing other demanding applications.
7. Exiting the Program
Press the 'q' key on your keyboard to quit the application window.
